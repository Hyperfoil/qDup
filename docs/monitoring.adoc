## Monitoring
### watch
Some commands (e.g. `sh` commands) can provide output updates during execution.
A child command with the `watch` prefix will receive each new line of
output from the parent command as they are available (instead of after
the parent completes). This is mostly used to monitor output with `regex`
and to subsequently call `signal: STATE` or `ctrlC` the command when a
condition is met.
```YAML
- sh: tail -f /tmp/server.log
  watch:
  - regex: .*?FATAL.*
    then:
    - ctrlC:
    - abort: FATAL error
```
Note: `sh`, `wait-for`, and `repeat-until` cannot be used in `watch`
because they can block the execution of other watchers.

### timer
Another option for long running commands is to set a timer that will
execute if the command has been active for longer than the timeout.
```YAML
 - wait-for: SERVER_STARTED
   timer:
     60s:
     - log: still waiting 
     120_000: #ms
     - abort: server took too long to start, aborting
```
Note: `sh`, `wait-for`, and `repeat-until` cannot be used in a timer
because they can block the execution of other timers

### on-signal
A long running command might need to be altered if another script sends a signal.
For example a signal to stop a trace process with `ctrlC` or to send text to an interactive command (e.g. top).
```YAML
- sh: top
  on-signal:
    DONE:
    - send-text: q
``` 
Note: `sh`, `wait-for`, and `repeat-until` cannot be used in an on-signal
because they can block the execution of other timers
