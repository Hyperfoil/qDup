= read-signal

The `read-signal` will run the `then` commands if the signal `name` is reached
or the `else` commands if the signal is not yet reached.

[source,yaml]
----
- read-signal: ready
  then:
  - sh: this.sh
  else:
  - sh: that.sh

The `read-signal` command can also be created with yaml mapping but 'name' is
the only argument.
