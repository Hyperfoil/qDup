= js

The 'js' command is an opportunity to execute arbitrary javascript code on the
`input` from the previous command and a read-only view of the current `state`.
The 'then' commands will run if the function returns a "truthy" object or will be
skilled if the function does not return, returns `null`, `false`, or a string containing `"false"`

    (input,state) => {
        if(state.FOO){
            return true;
        }
    }

IMPORTANT: We are experimenting with a globals javascript object in master similar to jQuery or lodash
that will give read-only access to more of the qDup internals (signals, counters, and state).
It can be accessed with `$QD` but it is experimental and currently only in SHAPSHOT from master.
