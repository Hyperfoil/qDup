= queue-download

The `link:./download[download]` command will immediately download a file but most
of the time a script wants to download the file after the run. The `queue-download`
has the same 2 arguments as `link:./download[download]`, `path` and `destination`
expect the download happens either after the run stage or after the cleanup stage.
The download will only happen after cleanup if `queue-download` is called in `cleanup-scripts`
