= wait-for

The `wait-for` command is how scripts pause execution until other scripts have completed
a set of commands. The other scripts will `signal` the same name as the `wait-for` which
will tell the current script to continue executing.

[source,yaml]
----
scripts:
  doThis:
  - sh: doThis.sh
  - signal: ready

  doThat:
  - wait-for: ready
  - sh: doThat.sh
----

Scripts with `wait-for` will remain paused until either the expected number of `signal`
or all non-waiting scripts have completed. If all non-waiting scripts have completed then qDup
will assume the condition did not occur and will cancel the waiting script without aborting the run.
Cancelling the script without aborting the run lets us add diagnostic scripts for events that do not always occur.

[source,yaml]
----
scripts:
  server:
  - sh: run_test.sh
    watch:
    - regex: IDKWTF #looks for the debug string
      then:
      - signal: debug #tells the debug script to start
  debugResponse:
  - wait-for: debug
  - sh: jstack ${{pid}} > /tmp/jstack.txt
