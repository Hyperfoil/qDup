= sleep

The sleep command pauses the current script for a fixed amount of time. The time
can be provided as a number of milliseconds or as a list of durations.

qDup does not support duration units beyond hours. If your script needs to pause
for days or longer then open a support ticket, we would love to hear what you are testing.
