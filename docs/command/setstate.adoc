= set-state

The `set-state` command adds values to the qDup state. It accepts two arguments, `key`
and `value` then creates `key = value` in the run state. If `set-state` is created with
only a `key` then the value will be the input from the previous command.

----
- sh: echo bill
- set-state: name #will set the name to bill
- set-state:
    key: name
    value: beth #changes the name to beth
----

`set-state` can use the `RUN.` and `HOST.` prefixes to target the global run state or
current host state.  The `value` can be a simple scalar (.e.g string) or a YAML structure that
will be converted into JSON.

----
- set-state:
    key: foo
    value:
    - name: bill
      age: 20
    - name: beth
      age: 20
