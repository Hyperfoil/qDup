= script

The `script` command will invoke another script using the same ssh terminal as the current script.
The simple yaml syntax just accepts the target script `name` but the yaml mapping syntax can also
include an `async` option. Setting `async: true` will create a new ssh terminal and

[source,yaml]
----
- script: create_unique_name
- script:
    name: setup_runtime
    async: true
----

Using `async` will start the script in an independent ssh terminal. The next
sibling will run while the `script` is running and any `then` from the `script` will
run as part of the new ssh terminal. Because `async` uses a separate ssh terminal it will
create a copy of the current script's `state` and will no modify the same state.
Environment changes in the script and its `then` will not be shared with the subsequent commands
in the original script.
