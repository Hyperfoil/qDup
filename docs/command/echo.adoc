= echo

This command writes the input (the output from the previous command) to the qDup console log.

- echo #no arguments

We normally use `echo` to `watch` a long-running `sh` command when debugging a script.

.qdup.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
scripts:
  example:
  - sh: /root/database_reload.sh
    watch:
    - echo #observe the script when writing or debugging
----

The `echo` command should be removed from a script once it works as expected.
