== Introduction

qDup is an agent-less, automation and coordination tool; used to coordinate tasks across multiple machines without any agents running on the target machines.

qDup allows for the co-ordination of many activities across multiple machines, allowing complex co-ordination of benchmarking steps to be managed and repeatable.

qDup uses ssh, no special agents or languages required.
We recommend using ssh keys to connect without passwords but user passwords can be included in the yaml.

== Concepts

qDup scripts contain the following sections;

* scripts - the sequence of commands to run on hosts
* hosts - the configuration for connecting via ssh
* roles - assign scripts to hosts to define the steps in the test
