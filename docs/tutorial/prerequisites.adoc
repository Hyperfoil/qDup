= qDup Prerequisites

== Linux
qDup is designed to work with linux.

We do not have Windows or Mac computers available for testing so the tool is not expected to run from those operating systems.

== SSH

qDup uses ssh to connect with other computers.
If you do not have ssh running on another computer you can start ssh on your computer.

```
#> sudo systemctl start sshd
```
If your user does not have sudo permissions you will need change to the root user then start sshd
```
#> su
Password:
#> systemctl start sshd
```
Test that ssh is running by trying to ssh to `localhost`
```
#> ssh localhost
Password:
Last login: Thu Sep 15 10:00:00 2022 from 192.168.0.1
```
The `ssh` command works with just a computer name but qDup needs a username along with the name of the computer.
```
#> whoami
testuser
```
qDup can work username and password but it more secure to use key based authentication. First, check if you already have keys
```
#> ls -al ~/.ssh
-rw-------.  1 testuser testuser  1675 Sep 15  2022 id_rsa
-rw-r--r--.  1 testuser testuser   398 Sep 15  2020 id_rsa.pub
...
```
If you want to use your existing keys then you need to remember the file name. We are going to create temporary keys.
First, if `ls -al` gave an error `No such file or directory` then you need to create the .ssh directory
```
#> mkdir ~/.ssh
```
Then create a new key
```
#> ssh-keygen -f ~/.ssh/qdup -t ecdsa
Generating public/private ecdsa key pair.
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in /home/testuser/.ssh/qdup
Your public key has been saved in /home/testuser/.ssh/qdup.pub
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:... testuser@localhost
...
```
The new key needs to be added to `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` but that file may not exist.
If the previous `ls -al ~/.ssh` did not include a file named `authorized_keys` then create one and give it the correct file permissions
```
#> touch ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
#> chmod g-w ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```
Add the new `qdup` key to the list of keys.
Remember to substitute your user's name from `whoami` for the `testuser` below.
```
#> cat qdup.pub | ssh testuser@localhost 'cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys'
```
The `ssh` command should work with your user's name (from `whoami`) and the `localhost` computer name without being asked for a password
```
#> ssh testuser@localhost
Last login: Thu Sep 15 10:01:00 2022 from 192.168.0.1
```


== Java
qDup is distributed as a java executable jar (java's version of a zip file).
You need to have java 11 or higher installed to run qDup. We can check for java
```
#> java -version
openjdk version "11.0.10" 2021-01-19
OpenJDK Runtime Environment AdoptOpenJDK (build 11.0.10+9)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM AdoptOpenJDK (build 11.0.10+9, mixed mode)
```
if you see `bash: java: command not found...` then install [Java 11](https://adoptopenjdk.net/) or higher.
