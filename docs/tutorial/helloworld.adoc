= qDup Hello World

== Prerequisites
qDup has 3 requirements:

1. linux operating system
2. java 11 where you run qdup
3. ssh  running on the target computer

you can verify the prequisites with two commands:
```
#> java -version
openjdk version "11.0.10" 2021-01-19
OpenJDK Runtime Environment AdoptOpenJDK (build 11.0.10+9)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM AdoptOpenJDK (build 11.0.10+9, mixed mode)
#> ssh testuser@localhost
Last login: Thu Sep 15 10:01:00 2022 from 192.168.0.1
```
The `testuser` example user name should be replaced with the output of `whoami`.

If you get a `command not found` or the prompted for a `Password:` when running `ssh` then please refer to the [prerequisites](/.prerequisites.adoc)

== qDup jar
qDup is distributed as an executable jar (Java's version of a zip). Download the latest `uber` jar from [github](https://github.com/Hyperfoil/qDup/releases/latest)

== YAML script
qDup scripts follow use yaml syntax. We can explore the yaml structure in later tutorials.
Use the following bash command to create a test yaml file.
```
#> cat > helloworld.yaml << 'EOF'
scripts:
    tryme:
    - sh: whoami
    - sh: date
    - sh: echo ${{message}}
hosts:
    server: testuser@localhost
roles:
    test:
        hosts:
        - server
        run-scripts:
        - tryme
states:
    message: Hello, qDup!
EOF
```

== Run qDup
```
#> java -jar qDup-0.6.15-uber.jar helloworld.yaml

```
