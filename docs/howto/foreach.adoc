= How to iterate over input

The `for-each` command repeats its sub-commands (commands in `then`) for each entry in its input.
The `input` can either be declared in yaml or it can be the output of the parent command.

== input from previous command
`for-each` tries to correctly identify common command input. It checks in the following order:

1. json arrays or objects
2. newlines
3. comma separated (with quotes)
4. space separated (with quotes)

```yaml
- sh: ls -c1
  then:
  - for-each: file
    then:
    - sh: rm ${{file}}
```

== declared input
The other option is to declare input in yaml. This works well when the list is stored in state or when the options are static
```yaml
scripts:
  run-scripts:
  - for-each:
      name: entry
      input: ${{scriptNames:[]}}
    then:
    - sh: ./${{scriptNames}}.sh
states:
  scriptNames:
  - one
  - two
```
```yaml
- for-each:
    name: test
    input: "one two three four"
  then:
  - ...
```
