= How to react to other scripts while a command is running

Coordinating scripts with `signal` and `wait-for` works when one script needs to wait for another script. It does not work if a script needs to react to a `signal` while another command is running.

For example, `perf record` will record events until the command ends. We may want to end it when `mvn install` completes. We can do this with a `signal` after `mvn install` and using `on-signal` to handle that signal while `perf record` is running.

```yaml
scripts:
  perf-script:
  - sh: perf record
    on-signal:
      done:
      - ctrlC
  mvn:
  - sh: mvn install
  - signal: done

roles:
  test:
    hosts: local
    run-scripts:
    - perf-script
    - mvn
```
If we are using `on-signal` on an `sh` command that will not end we run the risk of something preventing the `signal` and the `sh` command hanging the run. We normally recommend using a `timer` with a good default time to act as a failsafe to ensure the script exits.

```yaml
scripts:
  perf-script:
  - sh: perf record
    on-signal:
      done:
      - ctrlC
    timer:
      10m: #10 minutes is more than enough time
      - abort: failed to reach done
           #ctrlC wouldn't show we failed to signal done
  mvn:
  - sh: mvn install
  - signal: done

roles:
  test:
    hosts: local
    run-scripts:
    - perf-script
    - mvn
```
