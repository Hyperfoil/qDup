= How to download files from remote computers

qDup has two ways to copy files from remote computers.

== download
The `download` command will copy immediately copy the file.
```yaml
- download: /tmp/result.json
```
This command is appropriate if the file will change while the qDup script is running.


== queue-download
The most common method for copying files from remote computers is to queue the download.
qDup stores a list of all files to download and will download them after the `run` phase.
qDup will also download any queued files from `cleanup-scripts` after the cleanup phase.
```
- queue-download: /tmp/result.json
```
`queue-download`
