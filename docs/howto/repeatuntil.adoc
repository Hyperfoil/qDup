= How to repeat until a condition is met

The `repeat-until` command will re-run the commands in `then` until the named `signal` is reached.
```yaml
- repeat-until: signalName
  then:
  - sleep: 1m #add a delay or the command run very quickly
  - ...
```
The `signal` can come from a different script or from a child of the `repeat-until`. If the `signal` comes from within the script then we normally `set-signal: ready 1` beforehand to ensure the signal is initialized before looping
```yaml
- set-signal: ready 1
- repeat-until: ready
  then:
  - sleep: 1m
  - sh: oc get po
    then:
    - regex: my-pod-name
      then:
      - signal: ready
```
The above example checks for a pod every minute.
This is a bad example for `repeat-until` because `oc get po --watch` is another option that would simplify the script and improve log readability.
```yaml
- sh: oc get po --watch
  watch:
  - regex: my-pod-name
    then:
    - ctlrC
  timer:
    10m:
    - ctrlC
    - abort: failed to start my-pod-name before timeout
```
