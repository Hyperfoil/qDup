= read-state

The `read-state` command evaluates a state `name` and invokes the `then` commands
if the result is not `null` and not an empty string, otherwise it invokes the `else` commands.

[source,yaml]
----
- read-state: ${{use_https}}
  then:
  - sh: curl https://server/index.html
  else:
  - sh: curl http://server/index.html
----

NOTE: `read-state` will run the `then` commands even if `${{use_https}}` is `"false"` because that is not empty and not null. Use link:./js.adoc['js'] if you want to perform boolean operations
