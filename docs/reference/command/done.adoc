= done

This command tells qDup that the current phase should be done and to cancel any other scripts that are still running.
If this sounds like a bad idea then you are right. If you think you should use this command to fix your scripts it means
something else is wrong with the scripts or how qDup is processing the scripts.

WARNING: Please, do not use `done` and if you feel you need to please open a github issue.
Consider `done` to be deprecated, unsupported, and dangerous. It exists for the rare
workaround while a bigger problem gets fixed :)
