= ctrlC

Send the ctrl+c interrupt to the terminal. This often interrupts the current shell command (e.g. `tail -f`).

We often use `ctrlC` while observing a long-running command. This can be in a `watch`, `on-signal` or `timer`.

scripts:
    example:
    - sh: tail -f /var/log/messages
      watch:
      - regex: error
        then:
        - ctrlC
      on-signal:
        READY: #something else signaled ready
        - ctrlC
      timer:
        30m:  #if tail is still running after 30 minutes
        - ctrlC
----
We can also use `ctrlC` in a `timer` to run a command for a fixed amount of time.

scripts:
    example:
    - sh: collectPerf.sh
      timer:
        60s: #collect 60 seconds of performance data
        - ctrlC
