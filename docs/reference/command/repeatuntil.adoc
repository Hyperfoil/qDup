= repeat-until

The `repeat-until` command is how scripts can repeat a set of tasks until the run signals a specific condition.
The command is created with a signal name and will invoke the `then` commands until the signal is reached.

[source,yaml]
----
- repeat-until: DONE
  then:
  - sleep: 60s #always include the sleep!
  - sh: jstack ${{pid}}
----

IMPORTANT: Do not forget the `sleep` command in the `then` or the script will loop incredibly fast.
