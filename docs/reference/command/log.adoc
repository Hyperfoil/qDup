= log

The `log` command accepts a single string argument and writes the output to the
qDup run log.

[source,yaml]
----
- log: some message ${{message}}
----

The log command can help provide updates for a long running command that is
set to `silent` because it is too verbose to include the entire output.

[source,yaml]
----
- sh:
    command: ./run.sh 3h
    silent: true
    watch:
    - regex: ramping up
      then:
      - log: run is ramping up
    - regex: measuring
      then:
      - log: run is measuring
