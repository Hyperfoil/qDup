= set-signal

The `set-signal` command can initialize or re-set a signal counter to either create
custom signals during script execution or re-use signals multiple times.

[source,yaml]
----
- set-signal: READY 2 #expect 2 calls to signal: READY
- set-signal:
    name: DONE
    count: 2
----

qDup uses `signal` and `wait-for` to coordinate multiple scripts. qDup will internally
calculate the number of times `signal` will be called for any signal name that
can be resolved at startup. Some signal names cannot be identified at startup therefore
the expected number of signal's has to be explicitly set with `set-signal`.
