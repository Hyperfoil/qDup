= parse

The `parse` command lets uses https://github.com/Hyperfoil/parse[hyperfoil parse]
to parse the input from the previous command. It can use either the name of an existing
parser factory (e.g. `Jep271Factory`) or a sequence of text parsing `Exp` using the
YAML syntax from the parse library.

[source,yaml]
----
- sh: cat /tmp/gc.log
- parse: Jep271Factory
...
- sh: cat /tmp/test.log
- parse:
  - name: timestamp
    pattern: "^(?<timestamp>\\d+)$"
    eat: Line
    rules: [ PreClose ]
    children: 
      - ...
  - ... 
----

The `parse` command will output the JSON it extracted from the input and invoke the `then`
commands or it will skip the `then` commands and pass the input to the next sibling.

IMPORTANT: This is a new command and the YAML format may change if parse changes.
