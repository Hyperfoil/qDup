= add-prompt

qDup detects the end of the previous command by looking for the bash prompt in the terminal output.
Some shell programs will change the prompt during execution (e.g. `psql`). Use `add-prompt`
to tell qDup to also look for a new prompt string so it can correctly detect when the new
terminal session (e.g. inside psql) is ready for the next command.
