= add-prompt

qDup detects the end of the previous command by looking for the terminal prompt at the end of the output.
Some shell programs will change the prompt during execution (e.g. `psql`). Use `add-prompt`
to tell qDup to also look for a new prompt string so it can correctly detect when the new
terminal session (e.g. inside psql) is ready for the next command.

- add-prompt: "/] " #jboss-cli

qDup checks the exit code of `sh` commands whenever the host supports standard shell commands (e.g. `echo $?`).
qDup does not check the exit code after a custom prompt from `add-prompt` unless the prompt is defined as being part of a shell.

[source,yaml]
----
- add-prompt:
    prompt: "/]>"
    is-shell: true
----

Setting `is-shell` to `true` enables exit code checking after the default prompt and the custom `/]>` prompt.
