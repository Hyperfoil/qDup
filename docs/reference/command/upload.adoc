= upload

The `upload` command copies a file from the machine running qDup onto the host executing the script.
The command has 2 arguments, 'path' and 'destination' but only 'path' is necessary.
The default destination is the users home folder.

[source,yaml]
----
- upload: /tmp/web.xml
- upload: /tmp/server.xml ~/runtime/
- upload:
    path: /tmp/server.xml
    destination: ~/runtime/
----

The above example illustrates the `upload` usage but it assumes the file already exists in `/tmp`.
It is more common for existing files to be kept in the same repository as the qDup scripts. qDup has
a reserved state variable that refers to the path to the qDup script. This allows us to upload files
stored in the same folder structure as the qDup script.

[source,yaml]
----
- upload: ${{ENV.SCRIPT_DIR}}/web.xml
